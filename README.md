# CS-330-Comp Graphic and Visualization

How do I approach designing software? I create a design document first and plan what and how to create the objects, what to add as far as textures and lighting and how to bring it all together.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? I learned a great deal about working with OpenGL.
What design process did you follow for your project work? I followed the design document I layed out and the OpenGl areas I learned about each week.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? Using the basic process, I could design and refine the process for future projects.
How do I approach developing programs? I studied the steps and made sure I understoof=d the order of how and when to add lines of code to accomplish my tasks. In graphic design the order of code is critical.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? I learned how to add and adjust different lighting methods.
How did iteration factor into your development? The more I learned the easier it was to understand the code.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? I learned more as I practiced week to week.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? I am majoring in Computer Science, the graphic course has taught me a great deal.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? I have experience now with Visual Studio and OpenGL.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? I will work if I choose to pursue a path in graphics by gaining more knowledge and experience with OpenGl and other programs like it.
