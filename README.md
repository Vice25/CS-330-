# CS-330-
Comp Graphic and Visualization
In this class I learned about adding shapes, adding texture, incorporating lighting and movement. Each week my experience grew as I was introduced to new concepts and processes for rendering with amazing detail. I have learned a great deal about down vectors are the starting point, how the screen was created, the background and how to add and refine shapes.
